The research, conducted in a population-based cohort from UK Biobank, highlights the increased risk of psychiatric disorders and related prescriptions among COVID-19 survivors, emphasizing the extra mental health burden imposed by the pandemic. Our study underscores the need for policymakers and health systems to develop priorities and long-term strategies for the early identification and treatment of affected individuals, especially in vulnerable survivors of COVID-19, to mitigate psychiatric disorders and enhance well-being post-pandemic
